        <h1>Final Project Proposal - Tyler Kraemer</h1>
        <h2>Maverick Drone Services LLC</h2>
        <p>
            This program will provide information needed about the company called Maverick Drone Services LLC.
            This is my own company that I am in the process of starting and I thought it would be a good idea
            to create a website for it to better display my businesses information to the world. This will include
            a mission statement examples of what we can do and pricing and scheduling for estimates or jobs. This
            site will also allow customers to know how to contect us and how to schedule an appointment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The language that will be used for this website is html and I will be hosting the static website on azure.
            I will create the website and write the code on visual studio code and use git hub to help store it and
            deploy it to the world through azure.
        </p>
